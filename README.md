## Inspiration
I noticed that, with the abundance of popular Western music, it could be difficult for young people to find their own cultures' rich and diverse musical traditions. This can result in a lack of awareness and appreciation for traditional music. Thus, I wanted to create an application that contains a list of traditional music across India.

## What it does
**Mystic Melodies**, is a music streaming app that lets you explore the rich and diverse traditional sounds of India. It contains a list of regions and their traditional songs, which we can listen to through the app effortlessly.

## How we built it
I first researched all the data regarding the various traditional music across India. Following I created App Design and a color palette that matches our purpose. For designing I used Figma, and to create the App I used Flutter, thus the app can be deployed across platforms easily.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working as a solo developer, I am proud that I was able to complete the app in time, with most of the features I expected and a well-edited Demo Video.

## What we learned
- How to play local and network audio assets in Flutter.
- Using Hooks in Flutter to ensure clean code

## What's next for Mystic Melodies
Further, we could expand our playlist to cover all the regions of the world and not only India. Which would result in a global cultural repository for music.
